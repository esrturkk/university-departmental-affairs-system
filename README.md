# university-departmental-affairs-system

This project aims to develop software that will allow a university's academic departments to manage their course and exam schedules. The software will provide a system where both administrative and academic staff can log in with authorization, organize classrooms and course schedules, randomly assign exam seating arrangements, and automatically generate class schedules for faculty members.

This project will lay the foundation for a department management system that reduces the workload of academic staff and increases efficiency.
